/**
 * Polymorphism :-

## Meaning of polymorphism ?

- describe a pattern in oop in which classes have different functionality while sharing common interface
but can be used interchangeably.
- the beauty of polymorphism is that the code working with the different classes doesn't need to know
which class it is using since they are all used the same way
- Making PHP more flexible and easier to work with and maintainable through implementing
& depend on  interfaces rather than concrete implementations. (via an interface).
- A real world example or analogy for polymorphism is a button ,
Every one know what a button does but how it dose something (via an interface).
- * CUT * have more than one meaning with ( Surgeon , Barber , Actor ) but it's one word
 * ## Types of polymorphism :
1. Compile time polymorphism / static binding / early binding
2. Run time polymorphism / dynamic binding / late binding
3. Method overloading / operator overloading
4. Method overriding / function overriding
5. Constructor overriding
6. Interface based polymorphism
